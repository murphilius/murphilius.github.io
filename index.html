                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>I grew up in Kettering, Ohio. I went to Kettering Schools in the first grade. Around fourth or fifth
                    grade, I
                    realized that I love working with hardware (and bits of software). It was here that I saw how much I
                    LOVE
                    building computers and messing around with parts. By the time I was in eighth grade, I had heard
                    about the
                    CTC
                    program for IT at Fairmont. It was then that I was pretty dead set on getting into the program.</p>
                <p>
                    Around the time that I was twelve, I had decided to start saving money for a computer. It took a lot
                    of
                    chores,
                    a lot of birthday money, Christmas money, and even Easter money to finally save up enough for my
                    dream
                    project.
                    By the time I was thirteen, I could see the light at the end of the tunnel. My plan finally started
                    by the
                    time
                    summer started. I bought certain parts off of Amazon, NewEgg, and even went an hour away to Micro
                    Center
                    just to
                    get something I had set my mind on. I had gotten all the parts by the time the summer ended, and I
                    was
                    ecstatic.

                    Around the time that I had got a job and started saving money for a few months, I had gotten
                    to
                    experience
                    wiring ethernet cables throughout the house. It was a nice project to see how much ethernet cable I
                    might
                    need
                    for a distance, and it was fun to use my brain to get the cables through the ceilings. Now that I
                    had a
                    substantially better internet connection, I was able to relax and play the casual video games I
                    enjoy with
                    my
                    friends.
