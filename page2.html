                <h1>Interests + Tech</h1>
                <p>I like to spend my time playing video games with my friends. My time spent with my friends is usually
                    us going out to lunch, going on a trip to Trader's World, or going to the local gaming cafe, Vyral,
                    to get a look at new pc equipment.</p>
                <p>My friends and I like to go out to eat, and a couple of the places that have caught our eye is
                    Raising Canes, Piada, Chipotle, and even a simple McDonald's meal.</p>
                <p>The video games my friends and I play consists of Counter-Strike, Deep Rock Galactic, Minecraft, Team
                    Fortress 2, Hunt Showdown, and Left 4 Dead 2. A solo game that I find both cathartic and nostalgic
                    is
                    Call of Duty Zombies.</p>
                <aside>I could ramble for days about my countless hours when I was kid playing Call of Duty zombies, about
                    how it's nice to let loose and zone out for an hour or two, mindlessly moving wave through wave and
                    navigating the intricate easter eggs the game has to offer.</aside>
                <p>If I had to pick my favorite game of all time, it would easily be the classic experience, Call of
                    Duty: Black Ops 1.</p>

    <h3>Here are some images of my setup and PC!</h3>
    I'm very proud of the way this setup turned out, as it gives me an L desk using my dresser, and my LED lights strung
    around the desk and dresser give a nice welcoming atmosphere. I think that it's noteworthy to say that I love the
    color purple.
